IceWM
=====

Package icewm-1.3.8 was released under LGPL license 2013-10-10.

This is a fork of the original IceWM CVS that is on sourceforge:
(http://icewm.sourceforge.net).  This fork is hosted on GitHub at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/icewm).  What it includes is all
changes made on the official icewm CVS repository on branch
`icewm-1-3-BRANCH', as well as patches collected from pld-linux,
debian, archlinux, the icewm bug list, other github forks.  It
also includes greatly enhanced EWMH/ICCCM compliance.


Release
-------

This is the icewm-1.3.8 package, released 2013-10-10.  This release,
and the lastest version, can be obtained from the GitHUB repository at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/icewm), using a command such as:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/icewm.git

Please see the `NEWS' file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the `ChangeLog' file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The `TODO' file lists
features not yet implemented and other outstanding items.  The file
`COMPLIANCE' lists the current state of EWMH/ICCCM compliance.

Please see the `INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)', please see the `README-git' file.  An
abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications
appears below.

This release is published under LGPL license that can be found in the
file `COPYING'.


Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get IceWM up and running is to run the
following commands:

   $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/icewm.git
   $> autoreconf -fiv
   $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
         --enable-shaped-decorations --enable-gradients
   $> make all docs nls
   $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install install-man \
         install-docs install-nls install-desktop

This will configure, compile and install IceWM the quickest.  For those
who would like to sepnd the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help,
some compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.


Configuring IceWM:
------------------

Documentation for configuring the window manager can be obtained from
(http://www.icewm.org/) or from the online manual: point your browser at
(file:///usr/share/doc/icewm-1.3.8/icewm.html).

Unfortunately the documentation is for version 1.2.27 and is incomplete
at that; however, it is for the most part usable.  Also, a rather sparse
`icewm(1)' manual page is available.


Included utilities:
-------------------

Currently, the only included utilities are icewmbg (a background setting
program), icewmtray (a system tray for the IceWM taskbar), and
icewm-session (a program to launch the window manager, icewmbg and
icewmtray in an orderly fashion).

Third-party utilities:
----------------------

Unspecified keyboard shortcuts can be handled with the `bbkeys(1)'
utility available from (http://bbkeys.sorceforge.net).  For additional
utilities see (http://www.icewm.org/FAQ/IceWM-FAQ-11.html).
